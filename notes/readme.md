## Core Idea

A universal browser "copilot" that organizes, summarizes, and acts on your web content (tabs, emails, chats, docs, notes, social feeds) with built-in AI, customizable for any workflow—personal, professional, research, networking, or even creative.

## Core Features (for all audiences)

- **Universal Dashboard**: See all your active content and tasks (from any site or app) organized contextually, not just as tabs or windows.

- **AI Summarizer & Assistant**: Instantly summarize, rewrite, translate, and proofread content from any site—one click to extract or act on information, using Chrome's AI APIs.

- **Smart Action Triggers**: Let users create simple "recipes" (like: when I highlight a job post, trigger resume autofill; when I see a meeting, summarize agenda). These are applicable for students, professionals, power users, etc.

- **Cross-tool Memory**: Search and find any snippet, contact, or resource you've interacted with—whether it's a message, tab, or note.

- **Personalization**: Adapt suggestions and workflows to user activity (surfacing reminders, follow-ups, or next actions based on their own habits).

- **Voice & Multimodal Support**: Interact using text or voice and leverage Gemini's multimodal capabilities to handle images/screenshots as well.

## What Audiences Could Use It?

- **Students**: for assignments, group projects, and note-taking
- **Professionals**: for CRM, emails, meeting prep, follow-ups
- **Content creators & writers**: for research, draft management, organization
- **Job seekers**: for networking, job tracking, resume/cover letter actions
- **Everyday users**: to manage personal to-dos, bookmarks, and reminders

## What Problem Are You Solving?

- Browser overload (too many tabs/apps)
- Context switching between personal and work tasks
- Fragmented information across sites, hard to find what matters
- Manual busywork (routine tasks, copy-pasting, note-taking, repeating actions)

## Judging Criteria Alignment

- **Scalability**: Modular design lets any user adapt the workspace to their needs—works worldwide, cross-language, for many user types.

- **Purpose**: Unlocks a new capability: adaptive browser context and AI orchestration not tied to a specific app or workflow.

- **Creativity & UX**: Unified, proactive, and user-friendly workspace in the browser sidebar.

- **Tech Execution**: Chrome AI APIs power summarization, rewriting, translation, and custom AI actions.

You can make onboarding interview-style, asking users for their primary activities so the system smartly recommends modules or workflows!

## Summary

This extension becomes the "universal AI sidebar" for Chrome—organizing everything and enabling quick action for any user and any task, with flexible modules for specialized needs but a baseline core for everyone. This is highly competitive for the hackathon's judging requirements!
